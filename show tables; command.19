Output of the SHOW TABLES; command:

Since I cannot actually connect to a live database, I will provide a plausible, example output that such a command might generate, assuming a typical database structure for a medical or appointment management system.

Example Output:

+---------------------+
| Patients            |
| Doctors             |
| Appointments        |
| Services            |
| MedicalRecords      |
+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
