Correct Approach
The task was to execute a SQL stored procedure named GetDoctorWithMostPatientsByMonth and submit its output. This involves two steps:

Writing the correct SQL command to call the procedure.
Running that command in a SQL client and capturing the result table.
1. Example SQL Command
The student correctly identified the SQL needed to call the procedure. For example, to find the doctor with the most patients in October 2023, the command would be:

sql
CALL GetDoctorWithMostPatientsByMonth(2023, 10);
Command Breakdown:

CALL: A standard SQL keyword to execute a stored procedure. (Some database systems use EXEC or EXECUTE).
GetDoctorWithMostPatientsByMonth(...): The name of the stored procedure.
(2023, 10): The arguments passed to the procedure (in this case, year and month).
2. Expected Output
The crucial missing piece was the output from running the command above. The assignment required submitting the result set, which would look like a table with the two specified columns: doctor_id and patients_seen.

A correct submission would have included a result similar to this:

plaintext
+-----------+---------------+
| doctor_id | patients_seen |
+-----------+---------------+
|         7 |            58 |
+-----------+---------------+
(Note: The actual values for doctor_id and patients_seen would depend on the data in the database).

Key Takeaway
The assignment was not just about writing the correct SQL statement, but about executing it and providing the evidence of its result. The student only completed the first part.

To get the required output, the student should:

Connect to the database using a SQL client (like DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, or a command-line tool).
Execute the CALL statement in the client's query editor.
Copy the resulting table from the client's output/results panel and paste it as the submission.
