To define the patient user stories as issues, you would typically use a project management tool (like GitHub Issues, Jira, Trello, etc.) and create a new issue for each story. Since I cannot interact with external tools, I will present them in a formatted way that represents how they might appear as issues, assuming a basic template with a title and a description.

Patient User Stories (Issues):

Issue 1: View Doctors List (Unauthenticated)

Title: As a patient, I can view a list of doctors without logging in.

The page displays a list of doctors with their names and specialties.
This page is accessible without requiring login credentials.
