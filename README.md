## Database Schema

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is the best way to visualize your database structure. You can embed an image of your ERD here.

*(Briefly describe the main tables and their relationships if the diagram is complex.)*

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- JDK 17 or later
- Apache Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 7+
- A running instance of PostgreSQL (or your chosen database)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-database-capstone.git
    cd java-database-capstone
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    - Create a new database in your PostgreSQL instance.
    - Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    - Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties with your database credentials.

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    # Using Maven
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Running the Application

You can run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

If your project exposes a REST API, document the main endpoints here.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `POST`      | `/api/auth/register`      | Registers a new user.                      |
| `POST`      | `/api/auth/login`         | Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.    |
| `GET`       | `/api/products`           | Retrieves a list of all products.          |
| `GET`       | `/api/products/{id}`      | Retrieves a single product by its ID.      |
| `POST`      | `/api/products`           | Creates a new product (Admin only).        |
| `PUT`       | `/api/products/{id}`      | Updates an existing product (Admin only).  |
| `DELETE`    | `/api/products/{id}`      | Deletes a product (Admin only).            |
