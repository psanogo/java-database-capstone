The Core Issue
As the analysis points out, the question required the output of the curl command. In many testing and development scenarios, it's crucial to show the result of an API call to prove that the endpoint is working correctly and returning the expected data.

Crafting a Complete Response
A full-credit answer would include both the command you used and the JSON output it produced.

1. The Command

First, you would show the curl command you wrote, which correctly targets the API endpoint to find doctors in the "Cardiology" specialty available at 10:00 AM.

bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/doctors/specialty/Cardiology?time=10:00AM"
2. The Expected Output

Next, you would include the JSON data that the server sends back when you run that command. Based on the request, the output would likely be a JSON array of doctor objects who match the criteria.

Here is an example of what that output might look like:

json

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dr. Evelyn Reed",
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    "availability": {
      "monday": ["09:00AM", "10:00AM", "11:00AM"],
      "wednesday": ["10:00AM", "01:00PM", "02:00PM"],
      "friday": ["09:00AM", "10:00AM"]
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Dr. Marcus Thorne",
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    "availability": {
      "tuesday": ["10:00AM", "11:00AM"],
      "thursday": ["09:00AM", "10:00AM", "02:00PM"]
    }
  }
]
By providing both the command and its resulting output, you fully demonstrate that you can correctly query the API and that the API itself is functioning as expected.
