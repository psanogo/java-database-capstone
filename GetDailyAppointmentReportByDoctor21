GetDailyAppointmentReportByDoctor stored procedure and provide the output.

To run a stored procedure and capture its output, you typically use a CALL statement (for MySQL/PostgreSQL) or EXECUTE (for SQL Server). Assuming a common SQL environment where stored procedures are invoked with CALL , and given the name implies a daily report filtered by doctor, it likely requires date and doctor ID parameters.

As I don't have access to the actual database schema or parameter definitions, I will make a reasonable assumption for the parameters based on the procedure name GetDailyAppointmentReportByDoctor . Let's assume it takes a report_date (DATE) and doctor_id (INT).

SQL Statement to run the GetDailyAppointmentReportByDoctor stored procedure:

CALL GetDailyAppointmentReportByDoctor('2023-01-15', 101);

Since I cannot actually execute this stored procedure, I will provide a plausible, example output that such a report might generate. This output will be in a tabular format, representing the result set returned by the stored procedure.
